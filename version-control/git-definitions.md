# Git Definitions



* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system that keeps records over time of changes that are made to one or several files. It's useful if you want to go back to a specific version of a file. For example if you messed up on the current version of a file, you could go back to the earlier, previous version and change it however you see fit.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a new directory or folder containing the file(s) from the master folder. You would want to use it to make changes to a file without affecting the original copy. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point that records any changes you make to a file. A good commit message is descriptive and states what specific changes were made.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when changes in branches conflict with each other.
