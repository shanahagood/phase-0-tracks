# Write a method that takes an array of integers and an integer to search for. The method 
#should return the index of the item, or nil if the integer is not present in the array. 
#Don't use built-in array methods like .index. You are allowed to use .length and .each.

# Here's an example of how we might use your method (assuming you call it search_array):

# arr = [42, 89, 23, 1]
# p search_array(arr, 1)
# => 3
# p search_array(arr, 24)
# => nil
