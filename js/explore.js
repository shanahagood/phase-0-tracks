//define function called reverse that takes one string as an argument. 
//example string: love => evol
// first index becomes 4th/last index
//2nd index becomes 3rd index
//3rd index becomes 2nd index
//4th index becomes 1st index
//  The index reads from smallest to highest so now
//  we want the index to read from highest to lowest.
// 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 needs to become 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

//Split string into an array.
//For each letter in the array:
//	find the current index
//Arrange index number from highest to lowest.
