// write a function that takes an array of words or phrases and returns the longest 
// word or phrase in the array. So if we gave your function the array of 
// ["long phrase","longest phrase","longer phrase"], it would return "longest phrase"


//Define a function called "rtrn_longest_p" that takes "array" as its argument. 
//For each string in the array:
//  index is equal to zero. 
//	Until the index is equal to the length of the string:
//		index is equal to index plus one. 
//	print index 
//Sort and arrange index of each string from largest to smallest.
//	If index is the first index:
//  Print "(string) is the longest phrase."
//End method
//Test method by calling "rtrn_longest_p" and designating an array as its argument.
