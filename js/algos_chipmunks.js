// write a function that takes an array of words or phrases and returns the longest word or 
// phrase in the array. So if we gave your function the array of ["long phrase","longest phrase","longer phrase"], 
// it would return "longest phrase". This is a logical reasoning challenge, so try to reason through this based 
// on what you already know, rather than Googling the fanciest solution or looking up built-in sorting functions. 
// Note that "some string".length will do what you expect in JS.

//1. Declare a function called "return longest phrase" that takes an argument called "phrases" in its perameter. 
//2. Iterate through each phrase in the array. 
//3. Determine the length of each phrase. 
//4. Print out the length of each phrase. 
//5. Sort the phrase lengths from largest to smallest. This way, the largest phrase is at index 0. 
//6. Print index 0.
